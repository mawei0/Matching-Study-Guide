# Matching-Study-Guide

I made this code to help with studying for my Database class and decided to share this with anyone who may need it. Simply change the terms and definitions to whatever you're studying for and run the code. A new window will appear and you will prompted to answer each question you have entered. You will not be able to go to the next queston until you get the current one correct. Hope it helps :)
